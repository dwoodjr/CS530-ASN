# Portfolio Website Assignment

For this assignment, I created a fully responsive personal portfolio webpage using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**. The majority of the interactive functionality, such as the **carousel**, **navigation responsiveness**, and **dark/light mode toggle**, is powered by **Bootstrap's built-in components** with enhancements from custom **JavaScript** for features like **form validation** and the **back-to-top button**.

The visual design draws inspiration from **Drexel University's styling**, combined with personal preferences for a **Material UI aesthetic** and a **Mica effect** for a modern, polished look. The design incorporates a dark blue and yellow color scheme for both light and dark modes, with subtle transparency and blur effects applied to key sections for a clean, engaging user experience.

The code is hosted on my **GitHub repository** for easy access and testing: https://github.com/dwoodjr/CS530-ASN/tree/main/ASN-2
